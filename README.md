> Building scalable, autonomous AI systems at the intersection of generative models, reinforcement learning, and high-performance distributed infrastructure.

## Highlights
- BITS Pilani (Computer Science), MITx MicroMasters in Statistics & Data Science
- 5+ years production ML & distributed systems (recommendation engines, malware detection, multimodal agents)
- Primary stack: Python → Go, PyTorch → Flink, Kubernetes → VertexAI, Kafka.

## Current Focus (2025–2026)
- Scaling multimodal agents to 100k+ concurrent sessions (Ray + vLLM + custom scheduler)
- Quantum-inspired optimization for large-scale RL.
- Open-source distributed training primitives for Grok-scale models


## Let’s Build Together
Open to:
- Consulting on production ML / agentic systems
- Research collaborations (multimodal, RL, distributed training)
- Advisory roles for AI startups
